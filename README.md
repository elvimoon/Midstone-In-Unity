# Midstone-In-Unity
GAME208 Midstone Unity Port

Implement a prototype 2D game based off the engine created in the midstone class. The demo should
showcase the features of the engine that is being created, such as graphics rendering, ai, physics, game
mechanics, etcâ€¦ One playable level should be implemented with a character, two enemies with AI,
spawning with dynamic memory management, inheritance and composition for Object Oriented
programming, and physics.

Teams should provide a write up of what will be implemented in the game engine for midstone. The
write up will document and serve as a tool to create the submission schedule for the project. Weekly
check-ins/progress updates will begin during week 6.

Teams should book meetings bi-weekly to show progress on the build. There should be a minimum of
four meetings booked throughout the term for grading purposes. More can be booked for assistance
throughout the term using the Calendly link provided in the week 1 notes.
